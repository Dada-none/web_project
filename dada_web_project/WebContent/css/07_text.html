	In her essay, Woolf uses metaphors to explore social 
	injustices and comments on women's lack of free expression. 
	Her metaphor of a fish explains her most essential point, 
	"A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is 
	to write fiction". She writes of a woman whose thought had 
	"let its line down into the stream". As the woman starts 
	to think of an idea, a guard enforces a rule whereby women 
	are not allowed to walk on the grass. Abiding by the rule, 
	the woman loses her idea. Here, Woolf describes the influence 
	of women's social expectations as mere domestic child bearers, 
	ignorant and chaste.
